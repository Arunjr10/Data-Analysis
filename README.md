# Amazon prime title analaysis using powerbi

#### I developed a dashboard in Power BI focused on Amazon Prime titles, incorporating various visualizations such as donut charts, cards, area charts, maps, and stacked column charts to extract meaningful insights. The donut chart provided a clear representation of categorical data, allowing for a quick comparison of different genres or categories. Cards were used to highlight key metrics, such as the total number of titles or the most popular genre. The area chart illustrated trends over time, such as the growth in the number of titles released. The map visualization helped analyze the geographic distribution of titles, showcasing where most of the content originated. The stacked column charts enabled a detailed comparison of multiple variables, like the count of titles across genres over different years. This combination of visualizations offered a comprehensive view of the data, making it easier to interpret and derive actionable insights.
